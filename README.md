# RAG_chatbot_Ollama_websitelinks

1. Install Ollama (to run LLM models locally)

2. #pip install streamlit langchain_community
(We'll import the required modules from Streamlit and LangChain community libraries. Streamlit is used for creating the web app interface, while LangChain provides tools for text splitting, embeddings, vector storage, and retrieval-based question answering.)

3. #streamlit run <filename.py> 
if above command does not work try 

   #python -m streamlit run <filename.py>
